# Applies to FortiGates with bypass MMF ports (e.g. FG-80F-BYPASS, FG-400E-BYPASS, FG-2500E), which are a layer-1 optical switch that can fail open in the event of shutdown or system crash.
# But this failing open happens at the physical layer, so it can trigger when the session state table is maxed out. That's where the automation stitch comes in!
# If the FortiGate enters Conserve Mode, it's time to enable Bypass Mode. And if the FortiGate exists Conserve Mode, it's time to disable Bypass Mode.
# The bypass ports must be in a Transparent Mode VDOM in order to be able to execute the bypass functionality.
