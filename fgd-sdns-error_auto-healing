# If you're getting lots of FortiGuard SDNS Rating Errors, there might be something wrong with the dnsproxy daemon, in which case your DNS Filtering isn't working.
# Let's try to fix the problem by restrating the DNS proxy daemon.
# Let's also run some debug commands to help us troubleshoot the root cause.
# N.B. This stitch assumes that you have the Fabric Connector between FortiGate and FortiAnalyzer
# See weis-victor/faz-event-handlers-custom/fgt-dns-rating-error.json for how the event handler is defined
